## Operation: 

A script was added in the "package.json" document using the node js tool called "nodemon" which automatically restarts the node application when changes in the directory files are detected.

>"scripts": {

>  "dev": "nodemon ./index.js" }

Using the node development environment, having created the script earlier, we use the following command to start the server and the application.

>âœ— npm run dev

The benefit of using "nodemon" is that any changes made will be reflected in the web server when the page is reloaded.
